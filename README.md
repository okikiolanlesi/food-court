# Instructions on how to run code

* Download repo to your local machine
* Create a .env file and fill in the appropriate values using the .env.example file
* run 'npm i' in your terminal
* Before you do anything else run 'node setup/setup' in your terminal to seed your database with some dummy data
* You can now run 'npm run start:dev' in your terminal to startup your server 


You can test the endpoints using the postman documentation [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/22751768/2s8Z76uU8e)

If you would like to test the endpoints using the live link, theres no need to run the setup script in your terminal as the live database already contains the dummy data 

The live api link which was hosted on render can be found [here](https://food-court-eswk.onrender.com),
